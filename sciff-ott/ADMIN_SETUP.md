## üìû **Support & Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**"Invalid email or password"**

- Check Supabase auth users table
- Verify credentials are exactly: `praveend@lxl.in` / `Apple@123`

**"User profile not found"**  
- Ensure the user profile was created in the users table
- Check school association exists
- Verify RLS policies allow access

**"No content showing"**
- Run the sample data script for testing
- Check category and film tables have data
- Verify subscriptions are active and not expired

### **Database Verification Queries**
```sql
-- Check admin user exists
SELECT * FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'praveend@lxl.in';

-- Check admin profile
SELECT u.*, s.name as school_name 
FROM users u 
JOIN schools s ON u.school_id = s.id 
WHERE u.username = 'praveend';

-- Check categories and films
SELECT c.name, COUNT(f.id) as film_count 
FROM categories c 
LEFT JOIN films f ON c.id = f.category_id 
GROUP BY c.id, c.name;
