-- üîç DIAGNOSTIC AND FIX SCRIPT FOR USER PROFILE ISSUE
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor to diagnose and fix the "User profile not found" error

-- Step 1: Check if admin user exists in auth.users
SELECT 
    'AUTH USER CHECK' as check_type,
    id,
    email,
    created_at,
    email_confirmed_at
FROM auth.users 
WHERE email = 'praveend@lxl.in';

-- Step 2: Check if admin user profile exists in users table
SELECT 
    'USER PROFILE CHECK' as check_type,
    id,
    username,
    role,
    school_id,
    is_active,
    created_at
FROM users 
WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'praveend@lxl.in');

-- Step 3: Check admin school
SELECT 
    'ADMIN SCHOOL CHECK' as check_type,
    id,
    name,
    code,
    contact_email,
    is_active
FROM schools 
WHERE code = 'ADMIN001';

-- Step 4: Fix missing user profile (if needed)

-- Step 5: Verify the fix

FROM users u
JOIN schools s ON u.school_id = s.id
JOIN auth.users au ON u.id = au.id
WHERE au.email = 'praveend@lxl.in';

-- Step 6: Test login query (this is what the frontend runs)
SELECT 
    'LOGIN TEST' as check_type,
    u.*,
    s.name as school_name,
    s.code as school_code,
    s.contact_email as school_email
FROM users u
JOIN schools s ON u.school_id = s.id
WHERE u.id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'praveend@lxl.in')

-- Step 7: Final success messages
