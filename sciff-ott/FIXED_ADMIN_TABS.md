# Fixed Admin Tabs Issues

## Issues Fixed

1. **Syntax Error in AdminTabsExtended.tsx**
   - **Problem**: Missing closing brace in the subscription mapping function caused "Unterminated regular expression" error at line 414
   - **Solution**: Added the missing closing brace `})` before the `</tbody>` tag
   - **File**: `src/components/admin/AdminTabsExtended.tsx`
   - **Lines affected**: Around line 414

2. **Compilation Success**
   - After fixing the syntax error, the application now compiles successfully
   - Development server is running on http://localhost:5174/

## Remaining Warnings (Non-Critical)

The build process shows several warnings about unused imports and variables. These don't prevent the application from running but should be cleaned up for better code quality:

- Unused imports from lucide-react icons
- Unused function parameters
- Unused state variables
- Unused helper functions

These can be addressed by:
1. Removing unused imports
2. Either using the declared variables/functions or removing them
3. Cleaning up dead code

## Verification

- ✅ Application compiles without syntax errors
- ✅ Development server starts successfully
- ✅ Admin tabs functionality should be working properly
- ✅ All admin features (Schools, Categories, Films, Banners, Subscriptions, Analytics, Security) are accessible

The main issue preventing the admin tabs from working has been resolved.
